	Mnemonic:	tegu
	Abstract:	The middle layer that sits between the cQoS and the openflow controller (Skoogi)
				providing an API that allows for the establishment and removal of network
				reservations.

				Command line flags:
					-C config	-- config file that provides openstack credentials and maybe more
					-c chkpt	-- checkpoint file, last set of reservations
					-f host:port -- floodlight (SDNC) host:port
					-p port		-- tegu listen port (4444)
					-s cookie	-- super cookie
					-v			-- verbose mode
